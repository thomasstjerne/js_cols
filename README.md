js_cols is a library of powerful collection data structures for JavaScript. js_cols provides Lists, FIFO queues, LIFO Stacks, Priority Queues, sorted and unsorted Sets and Maps, Bags (Multi Sets) and Multi Maps.

The Library stands alone and is easy integratable in all kinds of JavaScript projects.
